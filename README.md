# bring_my_order

# part 1 shows server.js node js file, that allows user to recieve orders form customer.
# does a temporary save in local array.
#
# part 2 added the call to bringg api, created customer and aded order (task)
#
# Part 3 added GET call, to get last week tasks of the specified customer.
# currently it brings only the first page, need to complete passing over all pages availble 
# it will be kind of recursion, that while there are results from api, run next page, until you get empty array...
# then, take only last week's tasks.
